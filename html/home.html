			About
		</h2>
		<p>
			Hi I'm Vatsal Ojha. I'm a math/CS major at Carnegie Mellon. This is sorta just a website for me to keep track of stuff for myself and to give a more interesting overview of myself to others as opposed to a resume or something like that. I'll be consistently updating this site with things I find interesting or just things I want to keep track of. 
		</p>

			Current Projects
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Clippy
		</h3>
		<p>
			This is the main project I'm working on right now. Clippy is a Slack App which is currently integrated into the slack group for my house in Pittsburgh. I'm hoping to keep this as a running project for multiple people to work on. In addition to random functionalities (like keeping track of groceries/payments), it provides a platform for more fun projects to pursue in the future. More detail is given under the Projects tab.

		<h3>
			This Website
		</h3>
			As said earlier, this website is mostly for personal use as well as providing a fun introduction to myself apart from my resume. I'll be updating this website continuously as I get more ideas to update the site with. Again, there's more detail under the Projects tab.
		<h2 class="title">Random Questions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Are there certain parts of letters which are more/less important to legibility? If so, it would be interesting to see the effects of teaching kids to write while emphasizing those parts of each letter (so those dotted lines we used to practice on maybe are a bit bolded in the important parts). It'd be cool if this could improve legibility.</li>
			<li>Currently, American high school math is extremely application focused, which leads to a very skewed perception of what math is really like. There definitely are quite a bit of benefits of teaching application focused math (namely that most people don't pursue math as a career), but I wonder if it would be more beneficial for everyone if proof-based mathematics was introduced earlier. Would application based math classes benefit from this kind of rigor for common people, or would it just be a distraction?</li>
